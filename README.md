# Pandora's Box

This repository contains the codes from the Problem I solved for my final task during my task phase for Project MANAS
It's a couple of basic codes that use Keras and sci-kit learn to do some basic tasks on MNIST.

# TASK 1:
Unsupervised learning on MNIST: I used PCA followed by T-SNE to perform dimensionality reduction and used K-means to cluster the data.

# TASK 2:
Unmerging 2 merged images using deep learning: I used a simple Sequential Keras model to perform the following task.
I used autoencoders for this.
